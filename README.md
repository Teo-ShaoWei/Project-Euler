# Project Euler
My solutions to Project Euler problems.

## Disclaimer

It has been a silent agreement by user of Project Euler that we only discuss solutions with people who have also solved the problem. This is to make each problem a meaningful intellectual journey, and also to bestow street cred to solvers. I see the value of this proposition, and thus would like to urge anyone who is learning algorithm to make as much progress as possible yourself.

On the other hand, there are smart people who lack opportunity to cultivate good mathematics and computer science maturity academically. They may benefit from referring to solutions to gain some enlightenment in the topic. They may want to see a solution to a problem that they are so close to solving, thus closing the concept gap. They do not chase street cred, especially those that are not gain with their own capability, but they are interested to quickly learn something and build skills that will be beneficial in the grand scheme of their short life. For this group of people, I think there is nothing wrong to look at solutions after ample thinking.

So even though this repo is totally for myself, I left it as a public repo for the rare visitor who will benefit from it meaningfully.

## Repo structure

Problems are in their own individual subfolder inside `solution`, whereby the programming language used to solve a problem is indicated somewhere in the file/folder name of the source code, e.g. `optimised.jl`, `reference.py`, etc.
